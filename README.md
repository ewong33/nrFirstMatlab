This repository contains files for the following noise reduction filters: median, bilateral, diffusion and non local means. The baseline implementations have no suffixes in their name. The specialized implementations do.
If the suffix 3D is present, the spatial filter has been altered to operate on 3D data. If the suffix LAB is present,the spatial filter processes LAB data. If the suffix L is present, the spatial filter processes the L channel only, of LAB data. In the case of diffusion, Explicit implies specialized code written for the diffusion filter, that will be implemented verbatim in GLSL.
